And some good work on smaller scales did get done. Others of my colleagues in the diaspora that started in the early 80s wound up at Microsoft, DEC, IBM, Bell Labs, etc. </p>

This talk centered on Hamming&rsquo;s observations and research on the question “Why do so few scientists make significant contributions and so many are forgotten in the long run? </p>

Say a customer reports a bug, and you’ve got to fix it. You can fix it. You know you can fix it. Maybe it’ll take an hour, maybe it’ll take a day, maybe a week. But you’ll narrow it down, figure out the smallest possible increment of work you can do to remedy the problem, and then you’ll do it. And as much as it pains me to say it, because I want to be able to check that box that said I did the thing… this is the easy part. </p>

The first rule of investing is that it&rsquo;s never a good idea to buy anything just because everyone else is buying it. When the price of an asset is the result of herd behavior, not fundamental value, it&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;bubble,&rdquo; and bubbles always pop. </p>
